A proper implementation of economy plugin both for networks and standalone servers. 

## Implementation
Can communicate via multiple remotes at the same time. 
It means you can have *unique currency for one server*, while having *shared currency for whole network*. 

**Proxy**-**Server** communication is done with plugin messaging,to maintain it's reliability and compatibility with most proxies,
without having to open any new insecure network ports. 

## Supported Platforms
- PaperMC 
- BungeeCord
- Velocity
